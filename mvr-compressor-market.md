<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MVR Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Type</li><li>Roots Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The MVR (Mechanical Vapour Recompression) compressor market comprises two primary types: centrifugal and Roots compressors. Centrifugal compressors utilize rotating blades to increase gas velocity, offering high efficiency and standardized flow rates, making them ideal for large-scale applications. Conversely, Roots compressors operate on a positive displacement principle, using two rotating lobes to compress gas, providing consistent pressure and flow at lower capacities. Each type serves distinct industrial needs, with centrifugal units favored for volume and Roots for precise control.</p></p>
