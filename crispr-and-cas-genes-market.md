<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CRISPR and Cas Genes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vector-based Cas</li><li>DNA-free Cas</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CRISPR and Cas genes are tools for genetic editing, utilizing the Cas proteins to target specific DNA sequences. The market is categorized into two main types: vector-based Cas and DNA-free Cas. Vector-based Cas involves using plasmids or viral vectors to deliver the Cas genes into the target cells, allowing for stable integration. In contrast, DNA-free Cas technologies deliver pre-assembled Cas proteins and guide RNA directly into cells, providing a transient editing effect without altering the genome permanently.</p></p>
