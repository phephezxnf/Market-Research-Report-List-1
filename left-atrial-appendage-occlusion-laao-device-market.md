<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO) Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Endocardial LAA Devices"</li><li>"Epicardial LAA Devices"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO) device market comprises two main types: endocardial and epicardial devices. Endocardial LAA devices are implanted from within the heart's chambers, offering minimally invasive options for occlusion through catheters. In contrast, epicardial LAA devices are placed on the outer surface of the heart, usually via thoracotomy or laparoscopy, providing direct access to the appendage. Both approaches aim to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation by isolating the LAA from systemic circulation.</p></p>
