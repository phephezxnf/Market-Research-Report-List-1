<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The server cooling fans market primarily consists of axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, making them efficient for high airflow in compact spaces, ideal for cooling server racks. In contrast, centrifugal fans, which draw air in perpendicularly and expel it at higher pressures, are suitable for dense configurations where overcoming resistance is crucial. Both fan types are essential for maintaining optimal server temperatures and enhancing system performance in data centers.</p></p>
