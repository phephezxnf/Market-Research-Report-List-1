<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic and Hydraulic Direct Solenoid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Closed</li><li>Normally Open</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pneumatic and hydraulic direct solenoid valve market features two primary types: Normally Closed (NC) and Normally Open (NO) valves. NC valves remain closed in their default state, only allowing fluid flow when energized, making them ideal for applications requiring safety and fail-safe operations. Conversely, NO valves remain open until activated, facilitating flow when powered; they are suitable for applications needing immediate response. Both types serve essential roles in automation, controlling fluid dynamics across various industrial settings.</p></p>
