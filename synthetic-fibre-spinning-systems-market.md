<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Fibre Spinning Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Melt Spinning Machine</li><li>Wet Spinning Machine</li><li>Dry Spinning Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic fibre spinning systems encompass three primary types: melt spinning, wet spinning, and dry spinning machines. Melt spinning involves heating polymer until it melts and extruding it through spinnerets, creating continuous filaments. Wet spinning, used for more soluble polymers, dissolves the material in a solvent, then extrudes it into a coagulation bath to solidify the fibres. Dry spinning, similar to wet spinning, evaporates a solvent from the extruded filaments in hot air, forming the final fibre. Each method serves distinct applications in synthetic fibre production.</p></p>
